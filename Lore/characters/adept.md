# The Adept

## Overview
An elderly man who lives alone in a cottage at the edge of the old woods. Once a warrior, he now devotes his time to studying ancient texts and the nature of the realm.

## Background
- Former warrior who retired to a life of scholarship
- Has lived in the cottage for many years
- One of the few beings who knows the truth about purgatory
- Found the player collapsed near the cliffside and nursed them back to health

## Personality
- Secretive but kind-hearted
- Guilt-prone and quick to blame himself
- Protective of difficult truths
- Values conscience over material possessions
- Pattern of wrongly accusing innocents (gnomos, then the Valkyrie)

## Knowledge
The Adept knows:
- The true nature of the realm (purgatory)
- The player's unusual arrival and strange energy
- That some truths are "too heavy to carry"
- The Evil Eye feeds on forgotten souls and strips memories

He keeps these secrets because he believes the player is not ready to learn them.

## Possessions
- **Crystal Ball** - Family heirloom with teleportation magic (often misplaced)
- **Ancient texts** - Books about the old kingdom and realm's history
- **Chest** - Contains a longsword (opened with Adept's Key)
- **Shield** - Old shield from warrior days (stored in the attic, forgotten)

## Quest Involvement

### Crystal Ball Quest
The Adept mistakenly believes the gnomos stole his crystal ball, which is actually on his roof. The player can:
1. Find the ball and deliver the Adept's apology to the gnomos (peaceful path)
2. Kill the gnomos, then learn the truth (guilt path)
3. Find the ball after killing the gnomos (tragic path)

### Shield Quest
After the crystal ball quest resolves, the Adept recalls his shield and blames the Valkyrie in the Crypt. The shield is actually in the attic. The player can:
1. Find the shield in the attic, deliver apology to the Valkyrie (peaceful path)
2. Kill the Valkyrie, then learn the shield wasn't hers (tragic path)
3. Kill the Valkyrie and find the shield in the attic (double guilt path)

### Purgatory Reveal
After both quests resolve, the Adept reveals the truth:
- The player is dead, trapped in purgatory
- The Evil Eye strips memories from souls
- Defeating the Evil Eye is the key to freedom
