# The Player

## Overview
An amnesiac soul who awakens in the Adept's cottage with no memory of their past. Their true nature is connected to the realm's secret.

## Arrival
- Found collapsed near the cliffside by the Adept
- Unconscious for three days
- Carried no belongings or identification
- Exhibited a "strange energy" that the Adept sensed

## Memory Loss
The player has no memories of:
- Their identity
- How they arrived in this realm
- Their life before awakening

The Adept hints that perhaps these memories "were never there to begin with."

## True Nature
*See: [Purgatory Secret](../secrets/purgatory.md)*

The player is a soul in purgatory. Their amnesia is not trauma-induced - they literally have no past in the traditional sense. They exist in this realm as a test or transition.

## Abilities
The player can acquire various abilities through items:
- Combat (weapons, shield)
- Mobility (dash amulet, grip boots, jump ring)
- Travel (Orb of Teleportation)

## Dialogue Hints
The Adept provides cryptic hints about the player's nature:
- "It was as if your spirit was... elsewhere"
- "Sometimes [memory] was never there to begin with"
- "You're not ready" to learn the truth
- References to "bearing the weight" of truth
