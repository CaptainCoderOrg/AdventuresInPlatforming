# The Valkyrie

## Overview
A shieldmaiden who dwells in the crypt beneath the viking lair. Despite her fearsome reputation and surroundings, she is not evil - she guards the dead and maintains order in the crypts.

## Background
- Former shieldmaiden and warrior of great skill
- Chose to guard the crypts and protect the resting dead
- Lives among undead and monsters but is not aligned with them
- Carries her own shield, which the Adept mistakes for his

## Personality
- Fierce and territorial
- Protective of the dead she guards
- Capable of forgiveness when shown genuine remorse
- Values honesty and direct communication

## Combat
- Boss encounter in the viking lair crypt
- Phase-based fight with arena hazards (spears, spikes, blocks)
- Uses spear attacks, dash attacks, jump arcs, and dive bombs
- Title: "The Valkyrie - Shieldmaiden of the Crypts"

## Quest Involvement
The Adept wrongly accuses the Valkyrie of stealing his shield (which is actually in his attic). The player can:
1. **Peaceful path**: Find the shield in the attic, deliver the Adept's apology letter to the Valkyrie in the crypt. She forgives him and gives an arcane shard.
2. **Tragic path**: Kill the Valkyrie in combat, then learn from the Adept that the shield was never hers.
3. **Mixed path**: Kill the Valkyrie, then find the shield in the attic. The Adept realizes his mistake too late.

## Peaceful Resolution
When the player enters the boss arena with the apology letter:
- Cinematic plays (similar to gnomo apology path)
- Valkyrie reads the letter and accepts the apology
- Gives an arcane shard as a token of goodwill
- Exits the crypt peacefully

## Rewards
- **Shield** (combat drop): Dropped when defeated in combat
- **Arcane Shard** (combat drop): Dropped when defeated in combat
- **Arcane Shard** (peaceful): Given after accepting the apology
