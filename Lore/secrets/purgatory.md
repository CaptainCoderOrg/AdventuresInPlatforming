# The Purgatory Secret

**WARNING: Major story spoiler**

## The Truth
This realm is purgatory - a transitional plane where souls are tested before moving on. The Adept knows this truth but keeps it hidden from the player.

## Evidence in Dialogue
The Adept drops hints throughout conversations:
- "Sometimes [memories were] never there to begin with" - The player has no past because they're a newly arrived soul
- "Your spirit was... elsewhere" - The player's soul was in transition
- "Some truths are too heavy to carry" - The nature of purgatory
- "When you're ready to bear the weight... perhaps then we'll talk more" - Future revelation

## The Adept's Role
The Adept appears to be a guide figure:
- Watches over newly arrived souls
- Provides initial equipment and direction
- Keeps the truth hidden until souls are "ready"
- Has lived in the cottage "for many years" - possibly eternal

## The Player's Nature
- Not a living person with amnesia
- A soul that has entered purgatory
- The "strange energy" the Adept sensed is their spiritual essence
- Their journey through the realm is a test or purification

## Thematic Implications
- The monsters and challenges are trials to overcome
- The NPCs may be other souls or guides
- "Death" in this realm may have different meaning
- The ultimate goal may be transcendence or rebirth

## When Revealed
The full truth is intended to be revealed:
- After the player has explored the world
- Completed major challenges
- "Learned its ways" as the Adept says
- Possibly as a late-game or ending revelation

## Future Story Hooks
- What happens when the player learns the truth?
- Can souls leave purgatory? How?
- What was the player's life before?
- Are other characters also souls, or something else?
