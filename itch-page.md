# KNIGHTMARE

**A 2D action-platformer with combat, exploration, and moral choices. Plays in your browser!**

---

You wake in a small cottage at the edge of the woods. You don't remember who you are, where you came from, or how you got here. An old scholar tells you he found you collapsed near the cliffside. You have no belongings, no identity -- only a strange energy coursing through you.

Venture into a mysterious realm filled with dangerous creatures, multi-phase boss fights, and NPCs tangled in their own conflicts. Every encounter offers a choice -- fight your way through, or seek a peaceful resolution. The truth about this world and your place in it lies deeper in the darkness.
